## Key Points (Bullet Format)

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- **Simulate the real-world campus placement process**
- Model the 4-day internship recruitment cycle
- Predict placement outcomes based on student profiles and company requirements

### ðŸ“Š Scope
- **1,223 students** across 21 departments
- **79 companies** visiting over 2 serials (Day 1)
- Multiple roles: SDE, Quant, Data, Finance, Consulting, Core Engineering

### ðŸ”„ Multi-Stage Process
1. **Application** - Students apply to eligible companies
2. **Test** - All applicants take company tests
3. **Shortlist** - Top performers invited for interviews
4. **Interview & Hiring** - Companies make offers
5. **Acceptance** - Students accept/reject offers

## Speaker Notes

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Good morning/afternoon. Today I'll present a comprehensive simulation model for campus placements. This project aims to replicate the complex, multi-stage recruitment process that occurs during internship season."

### Main Content (1.5 minutes)

**Introduce the Challenge:**
"Campus placements involve hundreds of students competing for limited positions across dozens of companies. The process is inherently complex with multiple stakeholders - students, companies, and the placement cell - each with different objectives and constraints."

**Explain the Flow:**
"Our model captures this complexity through a 5-stage pipeline:

Starting with **Stage 1 - Application**, where students apply to companies based on eligibility criteria like CGPA cutoffs, department requirements, and domain preferences.

**Stage 2 - Test Phase**: All eligible applicants take company-specific tests. This is modeled using a Profile Score that combines CGPA, skill match, and randomness to simulate test performance variability.

**Stage 3 - Interview Shortlisting**: Companies select top N performers based on test scores. This simulates the real-world constraint of limited interview slots.

**Stage 4 - Interview & Hiring**: Shortlisted candidates undergo interviews, scored using a combination of their profile score, CGPA, and interview performance. Companies make offers based on their hiring needs.

**Stage 5 - Offer Acceptance**: Students receive offers and make decisions. Some accept immediately, some wait for better offers, and some opt out due to external factors like higher studies or family businesses."

**Highlight Key Features:**
"The model incorporates several realistic elements:
- **Randomness** in test and interview performance to simulate real-world variability
- **Student opt-outs** (5% probability) representing students who withdraw from the process
- **Over-offering strategy** where companies offer to more students than they need, anticipating rejections
- **Serial-wise processing** mimicking the actual day-by-day recruitment schedule"

### Transition (10 seconds)
"This conceptual framework serves as the foundation. In the next slide, we'll dive deeper into the scoring mechanisms that drive student-company matching."

## Backup Slides / Extra Information

### If Professor Asks About...

**"Why 5 stages?"**
- "Based on actual placement process at IIT Kharagpur. Each stage represents a real filtering mechanism that occurs during recruitment."

**"How does randomness work?"**
- "We use controlled randomness with fixed seeds for reproducibility. Random factors simulate unpredictable elements like interview nerves, question difficulty, or evaluator bias."

**"What makes this different from just scheduling?"**
- "Traditional placement systems focus on logistics. Our model predicts outcomes by incorporating student capabilities, company preferences, and competitive dynamics."

**"Can this be used for real placements?"**
- "Yes, potentially. It can help placement cells optimize company scheduling, predict capacity needs, and identify students who might need additional support."

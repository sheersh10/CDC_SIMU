## ⚠️ Common Interpretation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Focusing Only on Percentages
**Wrong**: "Dept A has 90% placement, Dept B has 70%, so A is better"
**Right**: Consider absolute numbers too. If Dept B has 200 students and Dept A has 10, the 60 unplaced in Dept B is more critical.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Department Size
**Wrong**: "Small departments always have better rates"
**Right**: Small departments have less statistical significance. A department with 5 students at 100% is different from 200 students at 85%.

### Mistake 3: CGPA Absolutism
**Wrong**: "Anyone below 8.0 won't get placed"
**Right**: CGPA is one factor. Skills, projects, communication matter significantly, especially in 7.0-8.5 range.

### Mistake 4: Day 1 Obsession
**Wrong**: "If I don't get placed on Day 1, I've failed"
**Right**: Day 2-3 have excellent companies. Day 4 also offers legitimate opportunities.

### Mistake 5: Department Determinism
**Wrong**: "I'm from Mechanical, so I can't do SDE"
**Right**: Plot 3 shows significant cross-domain transitions. Skills matter more than department.

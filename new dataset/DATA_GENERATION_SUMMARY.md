- **Dual domain**: 975 students

## Domain Assignment Rules Verification

### ✓ Quant Domain (Rule: 8% students, CGPA >= 9.0)
- **Total**: 93 students (7.6% of total)
- **All have CGPA >= 9.0**: YES (minimum CGPA: 9.00)
- **Department distribution**:
  - CS: 34 students (~37%)
  - MA: 18 students (~19%)
  - EC, EE, IM, ME: 12 students (~13% combined)
  - Others: 29 students (~31%)
- **All quant students have SDE as domain_2**: YES ✓

### ✓ SDE Domain (Rule: ~70% of students)
- **Achieved**: 75.3% students have SDE as domain_1 or domain_2

### ✓ Finance Domain (Rule: ~100 students, 70% from HS)
- **Total**: 92 students
- **From HS department**: 62 students (67.4%)

### ✓ Consulting Domain (Rule: 100-150 students)
- **Total**: 125 students
- **Distributed randomly** across domain_1 and domain_2

### ✓ Core Domain Rules
**Departments that SHOULD NOT have core** (verified):
- CS: 0 students with core ✓
- MA: 0 students with core ✓
- CY: 0 students with core ✓
- PH: 0 students with core ✓
- NA: 0 students with core ✓
- AG: 0 students with core ✓
- BT: 0 students with core ✓
- HS: 0 students with core ✓

**Core eligible departments** (ME, MF, EE, IE, EC, CH, IM, EX, GG, MI, MT, AE, CE):
- Core assigned as domain_2 (following rule)
- Department-specific core skills mapped correctly (e.g., CORE_EE for EE students)

## Skills Assignment
- **All skills from domain.csv included** for each respective domain
- For core domains, skills are department-specific:
  - EE students with core → CORE_EE skills
  - ME students with core → CORE_ME skills
  - etc.

## Domain Assignment Logic Summary

1. **Quant students** (93 students with CGPA >= 9.0):
   - domain_1 = Quant
   - domain_2 = SDE

2. **Finance students** (92 students, 70% from HS):
   - Randomly assigned as domain_1 or domain_2
   - If domain_1: domain_2 = SDE/Data/Core (based on dept)
   - If domain_2: domain_1 = SDE/Data

3. **Consulting students** (125 students):
   - Randomly assigned as domain_1 or domain_2
   - If domain_1: domain_2 = SDE/Data/Core (based on dept)
   - If domain_2: domain_1 = SDE/Data

4. **Remaining students**:
   - 250 students assigned single domain (mostly SDE)
   - Others assigned dual domains with priority on SDE (to reach 70% target)
   - Core eligible departments get Core as domain_2 (60% probability)
   - Core always as domain_2, never domain_1 (except for few edge cases)

## How to Regenerate Data

If you need to regenerate the data with different parameters:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\nigam\Desktop\Simulation 2nd Presentation\new dataset"
python generate_student_data.py
```

To verify the generated data:

```bash
python verify_data.py
```

## Notes
- Random seed is set to 42 for reproducibility
- To get different random results, change the seed in `generate_student_data.py`
- Original data backed up in `analysis_data_backup.csv`
- All domain skills are taken directly from `domain.csv`
- CGPA follows truncated normal distribution (mean=8.1, std=0.75, range=6-10)

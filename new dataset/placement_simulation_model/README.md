## üöÄ Quick Start

### Running the Simulation

```bash
# Navigate to the model folder
cd "c:\Users\nigam\Desktop\Simulation 2nd Presentation\new dataset\placement_simulation_model"

# Run Day 1 simulation
python run_simulation.py
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
python test_simulation.py
```

### Analyzing Results

```bash
# Generate detailed analysis
python analyze_results.py
```

## üìä Simulation Process

The simulation implements a 6-step multi-stage placement process:

### Step 1: Initialization
- Load companies for the current day and serial number
- Get list of unplaced students

### Step 2: Application Phase
- Students apply to eligible companies based on:
  - Department eligibility
  - Minimum CGPA requirement
  - Domain matching with job role

### Step 3: Test Invitation Phase
- All eligible students are invited for online tests
- No pre-screening at this stage (as per requirements)

### Step 4: Interview Shortlisting Phase (Post-Test)
- Calculate ProfileScore for each student:
  ```
  ProfileScore = (0.3 √ó CGPA_Score) + (0.3 √ó Skill_Match_Score) + (0.4 √ó Random[1-10])
  ```
- Shortlist top N students where N = interview_slots from company shortlist files

### Step 5: Interview & Hiring Phase
- Calculate InterviewScore for shortlisted students:
  ```
  InterviewScore = (0.3 √ó ProfileScore) + (0.5 √ó CGPA) + (0.2 √ó Random[0-10])
  ```
- Determine actual openings: Random(min_hires, max_hires)
- Extend offers to top K students based on InterviewScore

### Step 6: Offer Acceptance & Day End
- Students accept one offer (randomly if multiple)
- Update student status to "Placed"
- Apply opt-out probability (5%) to remaining unplaced students
- Reset statuses for next round

## üéØ Key Features

### Eligibility Checking
- **Department Matching**: Handles variations (CSE‚ÜíCS, MnC‚ÜíMA, Circuital‚Üímultiple depts)
- **CGPA Parsing**: Supports multiple formats (7+, 8.5+, NONE, conditional CGPAs)
- **Domain Matching**: Maps student domains to job roles
- **Skill Matching**: Partial matching with abbreviation support (DSA, ML, OOP, etc.)

### Scoring System
- **Normalized CGPA Score**: Scaled to 1-10 range (from 6-10 CGPA range)
- **Skill Match Score**: Based on percentage of required skills matched
- **Random Factors**: Add variability to simulate real-world uncertainties

### Company-Student Mapping
- Uses actual shortlist data from `company shortlists(csv)` folder
- Interview slots = count of students in shortlist files
- 40 companies with shortlist data successfully loaded

## üìà Day 1 Results Summary

### Overall Statistics
- **Total Students**: 1,223
- **Placed**: 120 (9.81%)
- **Unplaced**: 1,006 (82.26%)
- **Opted Out**: 97 (7.93%)

### Top Performing Companies
1. Google SWE: 11 placements
2. Amazon SDE: 10 placements
3. Microsoft: 9 placements
4. Blackrock Finance: 8 placements
5. Databricks: 7 placements

### Top Performing Departments
1. CS: 40.0% placement rate (36/90)
2. MA: 31.1% placement rate (23/74)
3. SD: 19.0% placement rate (4/21)
4. EC: 15.8% placement rate (15/95)
5. HS: 13.8% placement rate (9/65)

### CGPA Impact
- **Mean CGPA of placed students**: 9.17
- **Mean CGPA of unplaced students**: 7.93
- **High CGPA (9.5+) placement rate**: 89.2% (33/37)

## üîß Configuration Parameters

### Simulation Weights (in placement_simulation.py)
```python
W1_CGPA_PROFILE = 0.3      # Weight for CGPA in ProfileScore
W2_SKILL_PROFILE = 0.3     # Weight for Skill Match in ProfileScore
W3_RANDOM_PROFILE = 0.4    # Weight for Random factor in ProfileScore

W4_PROFILE_INTERVIEW = 0.3 # Weight for ProfileScore in InterviewScore
W5_CGPA_INTERVIEW = 0.5    # Weight for CGPA in InterviewScore
W6_RANDOM_INTERVIEW = 0.2  # Weight for Random factor in InterviewScore

P_OPT_OUT = 0.05          # Probability of student opting out (5%)
```

### Random Seed
- Currently set to 42 for reproducibility
- Change in placement_simulation.py to get different results

## üìÇ Data Dependencies

The simulation requires the following data files from the parent directory:

### Required Files
- **analysis_data.csv**: Student data with CGPA, domains, and skills
- **companies.csv**: Company details with job roles and requirements
- **company_order.csv**: Company visit order by serial number
- **company shortlists(csv)/** folder: Interview shortlist files for each company

### File Locations
All data files should be in: `../` (parent directory)

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending the Simulation

### Running Multiple Days

Edit `run_simulation.py` and add:

```python
# After Day 1 simulation
simulation.simulate_day(day=2)
simulation.simulate_day(day=3)
simulation.simulate_day(day=4)

# Export combined results
output_file = base_dir / "all_days_placement_results.csv"
simulation.export_results(output_file)
```

### Modifying Scoring Weights

Edit the constants in `placement_simulation.py`:

```python
# Example: Increase CGPA importance in interviews
W5_CGPA_INTERVIEW = 0.7  # Changed from 0.5
W4_PROFILE_INTERVIEW = 0.2  # Changed from 0.3
W6_RANDOM_INTERVIEW = 0.1  # Changed from 0.2
```

### Adding New Companies

1. Add company details to `companies.csv`
2. Create shortlist file in `company shortlists(csv)/`
3. Add company name to `company_order.csv`
4. Update `COMPANY_SHORTLIST_MAPPING` in `placement_simulation.py`

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Test Coverage

All 7 test suites passed:
- ‚úì CGPA Parsing (8/8 cases)
- ‚úì Department Parsing (5/5 cases)
- ‚úì Skill Matching (4/4 cases)
- ‚úì Eligibility Checks (All passed)
- ‚úì Student Creation (Passed)
- ‚úì Company Creation (Passed)
- ‚úì Scoring Functions (Passed)

### Running Tests

```bash
python test_simulation.py
```

## üìù Known Limitations

1. **Missing Shortlist Data**: 34 companies skipped due to no shortlist files
2. **Domain Matching**: Some companies (HUL, ITC, JPMC) had no matching domains
3. **Unicode in Terminal**: Some symbols may not display correctly in PowerShell
4. **Fixed Random Seed**: Results are deterministic (seed=42)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
Ensure you're in the correct directory:
```bash
cd "c:\Users\nigam\Desktop\Simulation 2nd Presentation\new dataset\placement_simulation_model"
```

### Missing Data Files
Verify parent directory contains:
- analysis_data.csv
- companies.csv
- company_order.csv
- company shortlists(csv)/ folder

### Low Placement Rates
Adjust parameters:
- Increase interview_slots
- Decrease min_cgpa requirements
- Reduce opt-out probability
- Broaden domain matching

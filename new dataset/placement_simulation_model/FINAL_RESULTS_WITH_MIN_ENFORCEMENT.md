---

## ✅ Critical Fix Implemented

### Problem Identified:
**Google SDE had min_offers=16 but only hired 11 students**

### Root Cause:
When students receive multiple offers, they randomly choose one company. This means:
- Google makes 20 offers
- 9 students choose other companies
- Google ends up with only 11 (below minimum of 16)

### Solution Implemented:
**OVER-OFFERING STRATEGY**
```python
# Companies now offer to 1.5x their target
buffered_offers = int(actual_openings * 1.5)
offer_count = max(buffered_offers, company.min_hires)
```

**Result:** Companies offer to MORE students to ensure they meet minimums after students choose
